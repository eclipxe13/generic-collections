Generic Collections PHP Library is a PHP 5.6+ that mimics the [Java Collections Framework][java].

As PHP does not have Generics this library will always implements type checks.
Don't worry, anyways you can always use the `mixed` type

For concrete classes uses a constructor approach:

```php
// collection = new Collection<Foo>();
$collection = new Collection(Foo::class);
```

For your own classes you could extend the abstract class and implement the appropiated
type methods, by example:

```php
class Foos extends Collection
{
    public function __construct(array $elements)
    {
        parent::__construct(Foo::class, $elements);
    }
}
```

Or extend the Abstract class, by example:

```php
class Foos extends AbstractCollectionStrict
{
    public function getElementType()
    {
        return Foo::class;
    }
}
```

## List of classes

Basic classes:

- [x] Collection: A collection represents a group of elements of the same type.
- [x] Set: A collection that does not allow repeated elements

Classes that implement `\ArrayAccess`

- [x] Map: A mapping from keys to values.
- [ ] List: A collection that can be accesed by their integer index and search elements on the list.

## About

This library is inspired by the Java Collections Framework
and PHP [ramsey/collection](https://github.com/ramsey/collection) library.

I see significant changes with ramsey's package, as I didn't want to introduce heavy
changes to his API I decide to create my own approach.

I had also take a deep search on [Packagist][] but couldn't find a library that ensure type checking on members.

Yes, my mistake, the repository username is `eclipxe13/` and the packagist name is `eclipxe/`.

## Compatibility

This class will be compatible according to [PHP Supported versions](http://php.net/supported-versions.php),
Security Support. This means that it will offer compatibility with PHP 5.6+ until 2018-12-31.

The support for cersion 5.5+ is not included since this PHP version will end 2016-06-10
and that is lower than the release of first version of this library.

## Documentation and examples

WIP. Be patient please.
